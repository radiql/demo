Example RADiQL projects implemented with Golang

This repository contains a collection of useful example RADiQL projects that you can use as a basis for you your own RADiQL projects. We've provided you with a range of example projects in order to help you try out RADiQL application development and to get started creating production-quality software solutions as soon as possible.

Each of the example projects can be found under the src directory in its own folder. Each project contains a README.md file that describes the project in more detail. 

Each example project also contains a HARMONY.md file that shows you how to create your own RADiQL development projects with AppStratum's Harmony tool suite. Harmony is integrated with GitHub and lets you create your own basic RADiQL applications with visual application design tools. Use of Harmony tools are free during your trial period.
