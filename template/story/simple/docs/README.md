# Story Documentation

Story documentation may take a number of forms, but in general consists of
Markdown (.md) files.

The objective in RADiQL is to reduce documentation to the minimum in order to
reduce the development effort while maintaining a documentation set that is
up-to-date and adequate for both usage and maintenance of a Story implementation.

Documentation may be autogenerated for a Story, either in full or in part.
