# User Interface Views

In Clean Architecture, user interface views are relatively dumb view layer 
components. 

## Toolkits and platforms

Each target platform has particular visual characteristics that may not be 
possible to replicate on other platforms. Cross-platform toolkits seek to bridge 
this gap. However, this isn't always possible or desireable.

RADiQL seeks to support both cross-platform approaches and platform-specific 
approaches.

There may be one view per toolkit/platform combination. For example:

- Qt/Linux
- Cocoa/OSX
- Microsoft UI Libray (MUIL)/Windows
- Vue/Browser
- React/Browser
- React/Native

Not all toolkit/platform combinations may be supported for any given component.

## Autogeneration of views

View components may be automatically generated by RADiQL and then customized 
by experienced web designers to acheive the desired user experience.
