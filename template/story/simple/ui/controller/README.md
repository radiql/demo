# UI Controllers

Controllers are responsible for converting a request by the UI into a 
request model specified by the Story Interactor. 

In other words, Controllers are responsible for bridging the impedance mismatch 
between the UI view model and the business data model (used by Interactors) 
for requests from the UI Tier to the Business Logic Tier of an application.

Please note that the view model (used by the UI Tier) and the business domain
model (used by the Business Logic Tier) may be very similar but are likely to
be different. Sometimes these differences are subtle. But often the two models
will diverge over time.

# Data Validation

Data Validation rules can be shared between the UI and the client but to 
guarantee that this is the case, they must be automatically generated by
RADiQL.

More sophisticated validation can be hand-coded if necessary.

# Autogeneration of Controllers

RADiQL can automatically generate controllers for a particular style of UI
and HTTP data transport protocol. For example:

- React-Redux over REST
- React-Apollo over GraphQL
- React-RADiQL over websockets 

# RADiQL ReduxLink

This is middleware for Redux

# RADiQL ApolloLink

This is an Apollo Link for RADiQL
